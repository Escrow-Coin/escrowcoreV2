## Introducing EscrowCoin

Introducing a new decentralized, open source, community driven digital currency, focusing on Escrow services.
The currency unit of account is **ESCO**, along with its exchange ticker.


##### Open Source
ESCO is open source. Anyone is free to contribute to ESCO development and make a pull request through Github. Further details, making community contributions as smooth as possible, will become available in the future on the new website.


##### Decentralized Ownership
Ownership and access rights are decentralized. This ensures that the long-term application and longevity is not dependent on a single individual any longer. This safeguards not only EscrowCoin future, but also your investment and partnerships.


##### Community Orientated
One of ESCO core values is being community oriented. Rest assured knowing that the ESCO foundation team will always strive to collect feedback and suggestions from the community and evaluate the input.


##### Trust & Security
Trust and Security are core concerns for users today as well businesses. To ensure that ESCO is as effective as possible Escrow Service application, ESCO will maintain a high focus on increasing anonymity and most important on creating trust and security.
